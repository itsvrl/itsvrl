### $ vrl start

`vrl stop` stops ongoing BYOB thread, this command is nice if BYOB crashes. You can then quickly start BYOB again using `vrl start`.

### $ vrl follow
`vrl follow` tails the log ongoing in the BYOB thread, this command is nice if you want to monitor your BYOB instanse.

### $ vrl help
