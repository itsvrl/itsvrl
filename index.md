```bash
# vrl-package comes with some commands

$ vrl help
$ vrl start
$ vrl follow
$ vrl stop
```

### $ vrl start
`vrl start` starts BYOB and threads the BYOB program in background so you can still use the terminal to achive other tasks.

BYOB's web-gui will open on you local network and will be reachable from anywhere on your local network. To see your local and external IP type `vrl help`

### $ vrl stop
`vrl stop`stops ongoing BYOB thread, this command is nice if BYOB crashes. You can then quickly start BYOB again using `vrl start`.

### $ vrl follow
`vrl follow`tails the log ongoing in the BYOB thread, this command is nice if you want to monitor your BYOB instanse.

### $ vrl help
`vrl help` is the vrl-package's own help command, `vrl help` shows other commands vrl-package offers, along with your local and public IP.
